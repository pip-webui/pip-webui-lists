npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install mocha -g
```

3\. Clone the project from github repository.

4\. Install project dependencies.

Install all dependencies for the first time:

```

Or update dependencies after they were installed:

## <a name="build"></a> Building

Clean **/build** and **/dist** directories. It is an optional step to ensure you removed any garbage.

Build source code. It will automatically check for errors and regenerate API documentation.
If any error found the build will fail.
```
gulp build
```

## <a name="publish"></a> Publishing

Uploading samples and API documentation to S3 static websites:
```
gulp publish
```

## <a name="release"></a> Releasing

1\. Check and update **CHANGELOG.md** file.

2\. Change version number in package.json. Remember: use semantic version and push changes to git repository.

3\. Set tag corresponding to the module version.

```bash
git tag vx.y.z
git push origin master --tags
```

4\. Publish release to the global NPM repository.

Remember: to publish to NPM you must have proper permissions from the team.
